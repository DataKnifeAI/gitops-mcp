# Fleet configuration file
# 
# Fleet will process all Kubernetes YAML manifests directly without Kustomize post-rendering.
# 
# Note: kustomization.yaml has been renamed to .kustomization.yaml to prevent Fleet
# from auto-detecting it and trying to use Kustomize post-rendering, which was causing
# the error: "must build at directory: file is not directory"
#
# This works because:
# - All YAML manifests already have namespaces and labels specified
# - Fleet can apply Kubernetes manifests directly without Kustomize
# - Individual resource files are self-contained and valid
#
# For local kustomize usage:
#   mv .kustomization.yaml kustomization.yaml
#   kubectl kustomize .
#   mv kustomization.yaml .kustomization.yaml
